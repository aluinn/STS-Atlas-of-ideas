    summary:
      "Carson's 1962 book synthesised ecological and toxicological evidence on pesticide harms, especially DDT, into a public argument for precaution that the chemical industry fought fiercely.",
    longDescription:
      'Carson, a trained marine biologist and science writer, argued that pesticide effects moved through food chains in ways agricultural science had largely ignored, and that policy should act on serious, well-grounded risk even before every causal mechanism was settled beyond dispute. Industry-funded critics attacked her credentials and motives rather than engaging primarily with her evidence, a pattern later repeated in other environmental controversies.',

      'Rather than rejecting objectivity, thinkers like Harding proposed "strong objectivity," arguing that making a researcher\'s social position and assumptions explicit, and including previously excluded standpoints, produces more rigorous, less parochial knowledge than a view that pretends to come from nowhere. Lorraine Code specifically challenged the traditional philosophical picture of an abstract, interchangeable, "featureless" knower — anyone, anywhere, reasoning from nowhere in particular. Code argued that knowers are always embodied and socially situated, and that this position shapes which questions get asked, which evidence gets noticed, and whose testimony gets trusted as credible. This tradition also documented concrete historical cases — including biased primate-behaviour and reproductive-biology research shaped by unexamined gender assumptions — where ignoring standpoint produced worse science.',

Unequal access to the most capable tools also raises the same old question of who gets to participate in knowledge production, in a new guise. None of this is entirely new: concerns about hidden labour, biased evidence, and contested authorship recur throughout the history of science. What is new is the scale, speed, and fluency with which an AI system can generate plausible-looking but unverified claims — which is why responsibility for checking and standing behind a claim is widely argued to remain with the named human author, whatever tools they used.',
