      'Zheng He\'s fleets dwarfed anything Europe would send for the next century, relying on sophisticated compass navigation, star charts, and shipbuilding. The voyages aimed at tribute, trade, and prestige rather than colonisation, and their cessation after 1433 — driven by court politics and fiscal retrenchment, not technological failure — is often misread in Western narratives as evidence that China "fell behind," when it instead reflects a deliberate political choice.',
