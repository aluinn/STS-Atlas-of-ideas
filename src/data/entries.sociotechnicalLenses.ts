    summary:
      'A framework for explaining large sociotechnical change as interaction between small protected "niches" where novelty develops, a dominant "regime" of established rules and infrastructure, and a slower-moving "landscape" of broad external pressures.',
    longDescription:
      'Plain-language definition: new technologies or practices usually incubate in small, protected niches (an experimental energy cooperative, an early research prototype) before they can challenge the dominant regime — the interlocking rules, infrastructure, and expectations that make existing technology hard to dislodge. Landscape-level pressures (climate change, war, a pandemic) can open windows for niche innovations to break through. Best scale: nation or sector-wide infrastructure transitions. Strength: explains why promising innovations often fail to scale even when they "work" technically — regimes resist. Limitation: can understate the role of power and conflict, treating transition as a relatively smooth multi-level process rather than a contested political struggle. Example elsewhere on this atlas: the shift from natural philosophy to professionalised science can be read as a regime change, with new societies and journals acting as the niches that eventually displaced the older, informal "gentleman amateur" regime.',

      'A framework treating everyday practices — showering, driving, cooking — as the real unit of social and technological change, made up of linked materials (objects, infrastructure), competences (skills, know-how), and meanings (social significance, norms).',
    longDescription:
      'Plain-language definition: practices such as "commuting" or "showering" persist and change as their three elements — materials, competences, and meanings — link, unlink, and relink over time; a technology only succeeds if it becomes integrated into a stable bundle of all three. Best scale: everyday life and household/individual behaviour, aggregated across a population. Strength: explains behaviour change (or its absence) without reducing people to purely rational, individually-choosing consumers. Limitation: can be harder to apply to single dramatic events or decisions than to slow-changing daily routines. Example elsewhere on this atlas: the adoption of the word "scientist" and professional scientific practice depended on new materials (laboratories, journals), competences (specialist training), and meanings (prestige of expertise) all reinforcing one another.',

    summary:

Best scale: national or international policy debates. Strength: explains why policy positions can shift suddenly when a storyline loses credibility, even without new evidence appearing. Limitation: can be hard to say exactly when one discourse "wins" and whether that reflects better evidence or just better framing. Example elsewhere on this atlas: the climate-science-scepticism case shows a discourse coalition — not united by shared scientific findings, but by a shared storyline casting consensus science as uncertain.',

    longDescription:

Best scale: household and individual. Strength: captures the often slow, negotiated, sometimes resisted process by which technologies actually enter daily life, rather than treating adoption as instant. Limitation: developed mainly around household media technologies, and translates less directly to non-domestic or infrastructural technologies. Example elsewhere on this atlas: contemporary AI tools being "domesticated" into academic work (see Generative AI and Academic Knowledge) show the same slow, contested process of fitting a new technology into existing norms and routines.',

    longDescription:
      'Plain-language definition: asking "is this a scientific question or a social one?" is often the wrong question, because the two are produced together — a new way of measuring risk, for example, both reflects and helps constitute a particular way of organising political authority and responsibility. Best scale: nation and institution. Strength: avoids treating science as simply "applied" to a pre-existing society, or society as simply "using" pre-existing scientific facts — both are made together. Limitation: as a broad idiom rather than a specific causal mechanism, co-production can be harder to test or falsify than narrower claims. Example elsewhere on this atlas: the Daston and Galison account of historically changing objectivity norms is itself a co-production story — standards for trustworthy images both reflected and helped constitute different scientific institutions\' authority.',

      'Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker argued that the design of a technology — their founding case was the bicycle — is not fixed by efficiency alone but shaped by different social groups\' competing interpretations, until a dominant design achieves "closure".',

      'Plain-language definition: early versions of a technology typically have "interpretive flexibility" — different relevant social groups (racing cyclists, women cyclists, safety-conscious buyers) see different problems and solutions in the same artefact (the high-wheeled "penny-farthing" versus the safety bicycle), until design controversy closes around one dominant form, which then looks obviously "best" in hindsight. Best scale: specific artefact or product category. Strength: directly rebuts the assumption that whichever design wins must simply have been the most efficient. Limitation: the choice of "relevant social groups" to study is itself a judgement call that can under-represent groups with little power to shape the historical record. Example elsewhere on this atlas: debates over who counts as a scientist (natural philosopher versus professional) show a similar interpretive flexibility and eventual, contested closure around one dominant identity.',
