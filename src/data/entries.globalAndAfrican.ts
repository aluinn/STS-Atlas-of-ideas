    summary:
      'Historians of global science increasingly describe scientific knowledge as circulating through heterarchical networks — multiple, overlapping connections — rather than radiating outward from a single controlling centre, while some knowledge still travels far more easily than other knowledge.',
    longDescription:
      'Older "diffusionist" histories pictured science spreading outward from a European centre to a passive periphery. More recent scholarship, including work on the circulation of knowledge between South Asia and Europe, shows instead a heterarchical pattern: multiple centres, cross-cutting connections, and genuine two-way exchange, where the connections between places often mattered as much as any single dominant institution. At the same time, knowledge does not circulate evenly: some knowledge is readily codified and travels easily (a chemical formula, a mathematical proof), while other knowledge is "sticky" — remaining tied to specific places, tacit skills, and embodied practices that resist easy transfer (a craft technique, a farmer\'s feel for local soil). International science can function as a genuine public good while still reproducing inequality: researchers in wealthier countries frequently define research agendas and retain authorship credit, while researchers and communities elsewhere are treated mainly as sites of data collection — and governance of international collaboration often lags well behind the pace of the research networks themselves.',

    summary:
      'A critical term for the frequently unexamined assumption that research directed and funded by wealthy institutions in wealthy countries will automatically, eventually benefit less powerful communities elsewhere, without those communities having any say in setting the research agenda.',
    longDescription:
      'The assumption mirrors economic "trickle-down" reasoning: invest resources at the top, and benefits will eventually flow outward and downward. Critics argue this pattern has repeatedly failed communities who were treated as beneficiaries-in-waiting rather than agenda-setters — colonial agricultural science, some global-health research programmes, and internationally funded environmental projects have all been criticised on these grounds for defining problems, measuring success, and claiming credit in ways set entirely by funders rather than the people the research was meant to serve. This does not mean externally funded research never helps; it means the assumption that it automatically and fairly does so needs to be checked case by case, against who set the agenda and who controls the resulting knowledge or technology.',

      'West African ironworking traditions developed sophisticated furnace design, smelting technique, and metallurgical knowledge over many centuries — knowledge embedded in craft practice, ritual, and apprenticeship rather than written treatises, and often bound up with gendered symbolism of transformation.',
    longDescription:
      'Archaeological and anthropological research has documented African bloomery iron smelting dating back over two thousand years in some regions, using furnace designs and smelting techniques independently developed and refined through generations of embodied, practical skill. Smithing was frequently organised through specialised lineages or castes, with knowledge transmitted by apprenticeship rather than text, and smelting itself often ritually framed — Eugenia Herbert\'s research describes how smelting was frequently understood through gendered and reproductive symbolism, the furnace likened to a womb transforming ore into iron. This tradition is a clear case of sophisticated technical knowledge that operated entirely outside university or text-based institutions, and that colonial-era commentators frequently failed to recognise as "science" because it did not take a familiar written, institutional form.',

    longDescription:
      'Salt was extracted from natural brine pits around oases such as Bilma using techniques for managing evaporation and crystallisation refined over centuries, producing salt that was then carried thousands of kilometres by camel caravan to markets across West Africa, exchanged along routes that also carried gold, kola nuts, textiles, and enslaved people. This trade required precise seasonal timing, detailed geographic and astronomical knowledge for desert navigation, and social and logistical organisation to coordinate caravans safely across hostile terrain — technical knowledge distributed across a trade network rather than concentrated in a single institution, and transmitted through Tuareg social and kinship structures.',

      "Colonial agricultural officers promoted cotton cultivation through compulsory planting requirements, agricultural extension advice, and market controls, treating Ugandan smallholders' existing crop knowledge and land-use systems as an obstacle to be managed rather than a resource to build on. Farmers nonetheless adapted cotton cultivation to fit their own land-use strategies, often integrating it into existing intercropping systems despite official pressure for monoculture. The episode illustrates both the genuine agricultural science colonial administrations claimed to apply (seed selection, pest management, soil assessment) and how that science was deployed within a coercive system designed primarily to generate export revenue for the colonial economy, not to serve the welfare of Ugandan farmers.",
