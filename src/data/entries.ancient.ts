    summary:
      'For centuries, Babylonian scribes recorded the positions of planets and the Moon on clay tablets, building mathematical methods to predict eclipses and planetary motion without a physical model of the cosmos.',
    longDescription:
      'Beginning well before the first millennium BCE, Mesopotamian scribes kept systematic diaries of celestial omens that gradually became a tradition of mathematical prediction. By the later Babylonian period, astronomers used arithmetic schemes — not geometric models — to forecast lunar eclipses, planetary stations, and the length of months with remarkable accuracy. This tradition treated the sky as something whose regularities could be captured numerically, independent of any claim about what physically caused them.',
