    subtitle: 'Local knowledge versus official expertise after Chernobyl',
    kind: 'event',
    period: 'environmental-contemporary',
    summary:
      "Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, UK government scientists repeatedly gave Cumbrian hill-sheep farmers restriction advice based on models that assumed the wrong soil type and underestimated how radioactive caesium would behave locally — advice the farmers' own practical knowledge of their land often contradicted.",
    longDescription:
      'Brian Wynne\'s study documented how scientists initially predicted restrictions on sheep movement and sale would last only about three weeks, based on models assuming alkaline soils that would bind caesium — when much of the affected Cumbrian upland is in fact acidic peat, on which caesium behaves very differently and persists far longer. Restrictions ultimately lasted over a decade in places. Farmers\' detailed, practical knowledge of their own land and animals was initially dismissed by visiting scientists, deepening local distrust that Wynne argued was not irrational "ignorance" of science but a reasonable response to repeatedly wrong official predictions delivered with unwarranted confidence. The case became a foundational example for arguing that public scepticism of expertise can reflect legitimate, situated knowledge and a realistic assessment of institutional trustworthiness, not simply a deficit of scientific understanding.',

    summary:
      'In the late 1980s and 1990s, AIDS activists — many with no formal scientific training — mastered the technical literature on HIV treatment and clinical-trial design well enough to directly influence FDA policy and trial protocols, becoming genuine contributors to the research process rather than passive research subjects.',
    longDescription:
      'Groups associated with ACT UP and related treatment-activist networks argued that standard double-blind placebo trial design was ethically and practically unsuited to a fast-moving fatal epidemic, pushed for expanded access programmes, and became sufficiently fluent in virology and trial methodology to sit on research review bodies as substantive participants. Sociologist Steven Epstein\'s study of this movement, and later work by Harry Collins and Robert Evans, distinguished "contributory expertise" (the ability to actually contribute original research), "interactional expertise" (deep enough fluency in a field\'s language to contribute meaningfully to its debates without doing its technical work oneself), and expertise attributed mainly through social relationships and trust rather than credentials — categories AIDS activism helped make visible by demonstrating that non-credentialed outsiders could acquire genuine interactional, and in places contributory, expertise.',

    kind: 'person',
    period: 'cold-war',
    summary:
      "Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction data was essential to discovering DNA's double-helix structure, and Chien-Shiung Wu's experiment confirmed the violation of parity in weak interactions — in both cases, Nobel Prizes went to male theorists whose work depended on these women's experimental contributions.",
    longDescription:
      'Franklin\'s crystallography, particularly her "Photo 51," gave Watson and Crick a critical piece of evidence for the double-helix structure of DNA; her data was shown to them without her knowledge via colleague Maurice Wilkins, and the 1962 Nobel Prize went to Watson, Crick, and Wilkins — Franklin had died in 1958 and in any case the prize is not awarded posthumously, but her relative lack of credit during her lifetime remains a widely discussed case of a woman\'s essential experimental contribution being under-recognised. Chien-Shiung Wu designed and carried out the 1956 beta-decay experiment that experimentally confirmed Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang\'s theoretical prediction that parity is not conserved in weak nuclear interactions; Lee and Yang received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for the theoretical prediction, while Wu, whose experimental work made the confirmation possible, did not share it. Both cases are frequently cited together in discussions of the "leaky pipeline" — the pattern by which women are lost from science careers at a higher rate than men at each successive career stage, through a combination of funding, hiring, and recognition bias rather than any single dramatic act of exclusion.',

    kind: 'idea',
    period: 'philosophy-of-science',
    summary:
      'David Bloor\'s "strong programme" proposed that sociological explanation of scientific belief should be symmetrical — the same types of social causes should be invoked to explain both beliefs we now consider true and beliefs we now consider false — a principle frequently misread as claiming all beliefs are equally valid.',
    longDescription:
      'Bloor set out four requirements for a properly scientific sociology of knowledge: it should be causal (seeking the conditions that produce belief), impartial with respect to truth and falsity, symmetrical in explanatory style (using the same kind of explanation for both true and false beliefs), and reflexive (applicable to sociology\'s own claims too). Symmetry does not claim every belief is equally true or equally well evidenced — it claims that *why a community came to hold* a belief, true or false, is always open to the same kind of sociological investigation, rather than reserving sociological explanation only for beliefs we now regard as mistaken (with true beliefs waved through as simply following from "the evidence" with no social dimension at all). Critics, including some realist philosophers of science, argue the symmetry principle still risks underselling how evidence itself can rationally constrain belief independent of social interest.',
