    summary:
      "From the 1970s, a new sociology of science argued that the actual content of scientific beliefs — not just the conduct of scientists — could be explained sociologically, breaking with Merton's earlier focus on institutional norms.",
    longDescription:
      'Where Robert Merton had studied the norms governing scientific conduct while leaving the truth of scientific claims to philosophers, SSK argued that social factors shape which theories get believed, not only how scientists behave. David Bloor\'s "strong programme" proposed that sociological explanation should apply symmetrically to both true and false beliefs, causally, impartially, and reflexively. This was a deliberate provocation to philosophy of science, and it opened the way for the more fine-grained, practice-focused studies (Edinburgh and Bath schools, laboratory ethnography) that followed.',

      'The Edinburgh school (Barry Barnes, David Bloor) emphasised broad social interests — professional, political, institutional — as explanatory resources for why scientists came to hold the beliefs they did. The Bath school (Harry Collins) instead focused closely on specific controversies, showing through case studies (notably disputes over replicating gravitational-wave and parapsychology experiments) that whether an experiment counted as a successful "replication" was itself negotiated, not simply read off the apparatus — Collins named this the "experimenter\'s regress". The two traditions overlap but disagree about how much weight to put on general social interests versus the fine-grained, local work of negotiation.',

    longDescription:
      'In The Mangle of Practice (1995), Pickering described scientific work as a "dance of agency": researchers try something, meet unexpected resistance from the material world, adjust their theories, instruments, or goals in response, and try again — a temporally extended process of mutual adjustment between theory, apparatus, and phenomena, rather than a theory being logically applied to data that simply waits to confirm or refute it. This shifted attention from the content of scientific belief (SSK\'s focus) toward the material, skilled, often improvisational doing of research itself.',

ANT shifted attention from asking \"what do scientists believe, and why\" toward asking how heterogeneous networks of people, instruments, organisms, and institutions are built, stabilised, and sometimes fall apart.

Crucially, these forms convert into one another: a prestigious degree (institutionalised cultural capital) opens access to a well-funded laboratory (economic capital) and a well-connected supervisor (social capital), which in turn builds a reputation (symbolic capital) that attracts further funding. Applied to science, this framework helps explain how advantages accumulate and compound across a career, not simply as merit rewarded but as capital converted and reinvested.',
